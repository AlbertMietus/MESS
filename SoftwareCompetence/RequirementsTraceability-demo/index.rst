   * For a simple development cycle, it easy to trace the validation the product:
     *All features should be covered by a test, and all should pass*.
   * When multiple products --or multiple releases-- are mandatory, this becomes quickly ambiguous:
     *Some test have to pass and only the essential specifications needs test-cases.*
   * Then ‘requirements traceability’ becomes crucial:
     **It gives insight in which ‘specs’ are required by each product/release and which tests are essential.**
   * This article (as part of a workshop) shows a down-to-earth demo how you set-up the ‘requirements traceability’ and
     how to use it.
   * We use the ‘tester view’: Be able to demonstrate the *product* **does** what was *aimed for*!
