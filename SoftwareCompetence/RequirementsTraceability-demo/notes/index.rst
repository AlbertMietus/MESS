To be able to make a compact demo, some “tricks” are used; like the “forgotten test”. Those tricks are documented here.

LATER/ADD
=========

* We can count the numbers of test, and we can insert links to each one automatically. By example, for the calculator requirements:

  :need:`CALC_ADD`:  has :need_count:`type=='test' and 'CALC_ADD' in links` tests defined. (:need_incoming:`CALC_ADD`)

  The count is only selecting the TEST. The list is alos showing the SPEC!

* Count/Ref all or only 1 step?

  :need_count:`type=='test' and 'CALC1' in links` test for CALC1.
