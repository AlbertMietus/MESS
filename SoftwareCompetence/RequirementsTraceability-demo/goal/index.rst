   “Requirements traceability is a sub-discipline of requirements management within software development and systems
   engineering ...”

   “... is defined as "the ability to describe and follow the life of a requirement in both a forwards and backwards direction”

   --- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_traceability

There are many reasons to enroll requirement-management and tracking them.

* First of all, it’s a good habit: without an objective it hard to succeed.
  *How can a system pass an acceptance-test when it is not clear what the (current) requirements are?*
* Often more urgent: in many domains, it is demanded by law or standardisation committees. In healthcare, automotive and
  aerospace “safety” is mandatory. Standard like IEC61508, and (A)SIL more or less demand a process with proper
  requirement traceability.

With the uprise of lean, agile and scrum, there is a tendency to skip less popular steps (and expensive roles); and
trust on craftsmanship. This implies the traditional "requirement management" approach has to change. And also that more
people are involved.

This chapter gives you an introduction into “tracking requirements”, in a lean, agile fashion.

After this *lecture*, you should understand how to annex (written) requirements and other specifications, to be able to
link them with test-cases. You should be able to visualize those relations, to get insight into which tests are needed
for a specific product-release. (And the other way around.) Besides, you should be able to apply this manually, for
moderately simple products. For big, complicated products, you probably need a bit more experience and the assistance of
a standardized process and mayhap a tool, to make it lean.
