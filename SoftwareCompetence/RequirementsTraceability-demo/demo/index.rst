Demo: Some calculators
======================

This section contains a few demonstrations of the  Requirements Traceability concept.
|BR|

We start with a very simple product: the ‘Simple calculator’ with only a few requirements and tests. We define those
specifications (using `“Needs” <http://sphinxcontrib-needs.readthedocs.io/>`_) and will show a (generated) :ref:`graph
<demo1_graph>` with the relations between them. By example, this shows which test(s) are needed to test a
requirement. And we directly see, there are no tests available for one requirement.
