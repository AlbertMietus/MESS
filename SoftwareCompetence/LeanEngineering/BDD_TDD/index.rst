Behavior & Test Driven Development
==================================

approaches for software development, which are very related. Therefore, I typically combine them into *Behavior & Test Driven
Development* (**B&TDD**)

Commonly those questions are like *“What the difference?”*, “:ref:`How to start? <startingBTDD>`” and *“How to learn it
properly?”*.

Although there are no standard solutions, there are fascinating common grounds that I can share.
