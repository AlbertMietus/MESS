      For fun, I use a formal notation here, as introduced by :ref:`RequirementsTraceability`.

      This shows we can see “implementing BDD & TDD” as a project with clean needs and steps. Be that as it may, I would
      do it less formally to motivate the team and use the formalisms in the background.
