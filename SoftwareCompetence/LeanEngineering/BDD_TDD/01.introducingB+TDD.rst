   Behavior & Test Driven Development can be seen as essential aspects of professional software engineering. Leaders
   such as UncleBob compare it to ‘double entry bookkeeping’: it’s crucial for accountants. He claims that when our
   industry doesn’t professionalize quickly, we have the risk that B&TDD will be enforced by law (too).
   |BR|
   So, it can be wise to learn to practice it, quickly.

   It is not easy to start when writing (long-lasting) embedded systems. We have other demands, codebases with a
   lot of history. Still, we can (& should).
   |BR|
   And we have an advantage, our Typically engineers are clever: When they understand the objectives, they will find a
   solution; that is their job!

      This old article was never really published. As it fits my new :ref:`MESS blogs <MESS_blogs>`, I reworked and posted
      it again. This is part I expect other parts coming weeks.


Ideally, each team should understand the concept of this *development process* **first** and then **exercise** it before
practicing it in a **project**.  However, IMHO, it is possible to learn it on the job. As long as one is carefully
trained & couched while practicing.
|BR|
A pitfall is to focus on the tools and learn new tricks. That hardly ever makes a process lean.

Instructions too often focus on using the tools. And almost automatically, the goal becomes to blend those new tools into
the existing Way-of-Work (WoW). Eventually, however, somebody will get disappointed. There will be no quality improvement,
no speed-up, or any effect.

.. tip:: Without set goals, one shouldn't complain when expectations are not met!

So, what are the goals one can aim for? That can be formulated as simply: a more Lean & Agile approach.
|BR|
Or even bolder:

  Design a (Modern) Embedded Software System that fits the needs of the end-users better, with no flaws, in less
  time and with less effort (cost) than traditionally.

   BDD and TDD should be *interwoven* with the typical steps in a development process and will **change the order**!

===========================
What is What (Introduction)
===========================

There are a lot of opinions on BDD and TDD, which can be confusing. As in many modern improvements, words often become
hyped to justify any change. That is not my goal. So let’s start with a summary backed by the definitions on Wikipedia.


TDD (`Test-driven development <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development>`_)
========================================================================================

TDD is a *process*; where the tests are described **first** and the code second. One keeps executing all tests until the
code works. This encourages good habits such as *refactoring* also.
|BR|
Change code is constantly tested, so the risk of inserting a bug is minimal.

TDD is typically practiced at the unit level (one file, class, or function), where the programmer writes test and
production code in a short loop (a minute)
|BR|
The are many variants, like **STDD** (system-level TDD), **ATDD** (Acceptance TDD), and **BDD**; the latter is
well-known and popular.

TDD also provides an *”exit” strategy* (see below).

BDD (`Behavior-driven development <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development>`_)
================================================================================================

BDD is a variant of TDD focusing on the system (or acceptance) level. Again, tests are written **first** and
executed *constantly*; when all tests are OK, the product development is *done*.

Here the testing focuses on the (top-level) requirements, the system, and/or business features. Typically, they are
designed by test professionals, system architects, or business experts. They are less technical compared with
TDD tests. And, to be practical, those tests are written in a dedicated tool; using a high-level *“almost English”
language*.

As the size of the change is bigger -- like a feature or user story-- the cycle is (also) longer. Typically a few days.

Like with TTD, BDD tests are executed frequently.
|BR|
Some prefer to “enable” new tests only when the feature is coded -- this prevents a failing test (as the production code
isn’t done). IMHO, one should avoid this. One should run the tests but in a lower urgency branch. And promote both to a
higher level when integrating (see an upcoming blog on this).


All levels
==========

One can (should) practice this process for all *levels in the V*.

Each classical *’test & integration’ step* can be split into a test preparation and an execution activity.  The
*preparation phase* becomes the **test-design** activity, executed early and resulting in an ATS (Automated Test
Script).
|BR|
That ATS is executed frequently (at least nightly) as soon as it is available.

Executing all tests at all levels for all units and modules and for every story and feature verifies everything. This
covers pure integration errors.  This covers pure integration errors but is also a safety net when mistakes are not
found at a lower level.

Remember: those ATSes run fully automatically. So, the cost of all those executions add-up to almost nothing.

====================================
Why not just write and run the test?
====================================

TTD and Unit Tests are related but not the same!  When practicing TDD, the focus should be on preventing flaws instead
of finding them.

TDD is a process that dictates when to write a test (first); when to write production code (second); and when to execute
the tests (constantly and automatically).
|BR|
The same applies to BDD, even though the frequency is slower.

Testability
===========

Everybody knows some code that is hard to test. I have seen functions without input or output -- acting purely on
global variables. We know globals are bad! And it is also untestable.
|BR|
We should avoid that.

By writing tests first, we enforce an implicit requirement: code should be testable. Besides:

 It’s hard to write untestable code when your write your test first!
