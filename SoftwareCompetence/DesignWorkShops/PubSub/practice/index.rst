Design Analye
==============

Given the python implementation, including the shown “Use-Cases”: Analyse the design in detail

1. Make a (quick) static design-analyse.

   Resulting in some package- and class- diagrams.

2. Make a (draft) dynamic design-analyse.

   At least a sequence-diagram for each of the “use-cases”

Port to C/C++
=============

3. Can you port (or re-implement) the python examples to C/C++?

   Surely, you have to change some details; as a generic data-type (“value”) is not available.

   It is fine, to use a *string-type*. And just “print” it in the demo-callbacks (like we do)
