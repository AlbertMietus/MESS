Demo (life)
===========

This section give a demonstration of an simple (python) implementation of :class:`pubsub.Topic`. It is available is two
forms:

#. A *revealjs* slidedeck of a jupiter/ipython notebook
#. An interactive notebook. This is the same notebook, which you can edit an run on public `“binder”
   <https://mybinder.org>`_

You can also `download <PubSub-demo-github>`_ the notebook, it is available on github.

.. note:: Same source

   Due practical details the slidedeck below and the interactive notebook might be our-of-sync. Although it coming from the
   same source, it can be another revision; making the slides is partial manual.
