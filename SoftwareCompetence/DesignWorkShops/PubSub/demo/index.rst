Demo (life)
===========

This section gives a demonstration of a simple (python) implementation of :class:`pubsub.Topic`. It is available in two
forms:

#. A *revealjs* slide-deck of a Jupiter/IPython notebook
#. An interactive notebook. This is the same notebook, which you can edit an run on public `“binder”
   <https://mybinder.org>`_

You can also `download the notebook
<https://github.com/AlbertMietus/PyMess.ipython-notebools/tree/master/SoftwareCompetence/DesignWorkShops/PubSub/PubSub-demo.ipynb>`_,
it is available on GitHub.

.. note:: **Same source, variable version**

   Due to practical details, the slide-deck below and the interactive notebook might be our-of-sync. Although it coming
   from the same source, it can be another revision; making the slides is partial manual.


Slides

         <iframe src="../../../../_static/PubSub-demo.slides.html" width="100%" height="720px"></iframe>
   </a>

.. tip::

   * Use **‘space’** to go to the next slide.
   * Use **‘?’** to see all keyboard *shortcuts*.
   * Click on the edge to open it in a new tab (and use ‘F’ for full-screen).


Interactive notebooks
---------------------

Run-on binder: `try it yourself <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/AlbertMietus/PyMess.ipython-notebools/master?filepath=%2FSoftwareCompetence%2FDesignWorkShops%2FPubSub%2FPubSub-demo.ipynb>`_

.. tip::

   Or download `Jupiter <https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#install>`_; e.g by
   `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_ (especially for Windows), or ``pip``

   Anaconda downloads: *(v2020.02;Python-3.7)*

   * `Window-64 <https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.02-Windows-x86_64.exe>`_.
   * `macOS <https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.02-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg>`_.
   * For other/newer releases, and other platforms, see https://www.anaconda.com

And play with it on your PC using this `notebook
<https://github.com/AlbertMietus/PyMess.ipython-notebools/tree/master/SoftwareCompetence/DesignWorkShops/PubSub/PubSub-demo.ipynb>`_.
With the benefit, you can save your changes.
