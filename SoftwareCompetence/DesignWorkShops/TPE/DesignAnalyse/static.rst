Class Diagrams
==============

Future (object)
---------------

Create the class diagrams for the python **Future (object)**.

.. note::

   * The term *future* is used multiple times in python. You need the one in concurrent-package!
   * Possible to your surprise, there is no “thread” specific one. Only the *base* version exist, which works for
     threads and processes.
   * See file ``concurrent.futures._base.py``


TPE
---

Create the class diagrams for the python *ThreadPoolExecutor*

The code can be found online:  https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/concurrent/futures/thread.py

Other diagrams
==============

Create all other (static) diagrams that you may find useful

Questionnaire
=============

#. Why is the Futures class-diagram so much simpler are the ThreadPoolExecutor one?
#. Which class is more important; conceptually?

------------------

   * :ref:`TPE_pyreversed_classes` for my elaboration on the static analyse
