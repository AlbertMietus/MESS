.. _TPE:

ThreadPoolExecutor
==================

.. sidebar:: English & Dutch

   This workshop is mostly in Dutch and partly in English; as it is based on an existing Dutch documentation. Only the new
   parts are in English. Hopefully, more and more part will be translated.

   Deze workshop is gebaseerd op bestaande, Nederlandse teksten. Voorlopig zijn allen de nieuwe delen in het Engels.

   This workshop is about the *ThreadPoolExecutor* (‘TPE’ for friends): a pool of workers implemented with
   Threads. This is a modern, advanced **design-pattern** available in many languages.

   You will get an introduction to the concepts, to be able to use the ‘TPE’. Also, we study Python implementation, to
   practice **design-analyse**.

The example code is both available in Python and Java; more languages will follow. As the python-TPE is open-source and
easy to read, that one is used for the design-analyse. In that exercise, you will analyse code to create some
design-diagrams afterward.

Last, you may use this concept in a next DesignWorkShop ...


As usual, this workshop has some sections named *Questionnaire*; those questions are meant to sharpen the mind. Thinking
about the answer is more important that the answer itself.

Some exercises will have a possible elaboration; often that isn’t only good one. Again: think about it. And learn!


---Have fun, Albert
