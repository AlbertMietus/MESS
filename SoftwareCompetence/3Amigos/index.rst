Leading Software/Enginering Teams
=================================

As a preparation to my ``#3Amigos`` training, I will write some blog/articles on (the difficulty in) leading (big)
teams that develop (Modern) Embedded System Software.
Most will be published both here, and on `LinkedIn <https://www.linkedin.com/in/albertmietus/>`_, see `Articles <https://www.linkedin.com/in/albertmietus/recent-activity/articles/>`_.

You are invited to add feedback!
