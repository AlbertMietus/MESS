Leading software teams
======================

As a preparation to my ``#3Amigoâ€™s`` training, I will write some blog/articles on (the difficulty in) leading (big)
teams that develop (Modern) Embedded System Software.
Most will be published both here, and on my `LinkedIn page <https://www.linkedin.com/in/albertmietus/>`_

You are invited to add feedback!
