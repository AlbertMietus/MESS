dPID: A Python ‘homework’ exercise
**********************************
:status: Alfa

This is an optional exercise for the python-3 workshops: program a **d**\iscrete **PID**-controller.

A basic :class:`class<dpid.dPID>` is given. Which has to be tested and implemented. By starting
with the *test-part*, which is advisable anyhow (the TDD approach), the exercise starts simple.

A few :ref:`test-examples <dPID_test_examples>` are also given. This file can be used as *’template’* to
write your own tests.
