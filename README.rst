   Sovereign Software
      All **unmanaged**, *background* software enabling modern life!

      * Traditional RealTime/Embedded software & their big successors
      * Compilers,  Kernels, Drivers, code-analysers, ...
      * Routers, PLCs, EMUs, the TCP/IP-stack, ...

      Traditionally, that “small” software was called “RealTime” and/or “Embedded”.  Currently most
      of that software isn’t *’small’* anymore, nor *‘embedded (in a product)’*. Furthermore, all
      *normal* software appears to be realtime; mostly due hardware-speedup.

      And, there is a lot of software, like (kernel)-drivers, compilers and SW-tools which really
      isn’t embedded, nor realtime; but should have the quality that is equivalent to that old-
      school engineering. As everybody depend on it -- directly (sw-engineering) or indirectly (a
      bug in a compiler will effect all end-users!).


   Modern Engineering

      Software-engineering is a juvenile profession, with many new insights.

      Most are recently *discovered* in generic software development; like ‘the web’. And written
      in a language (both computer and human), that is very contrasting with the technology-talk of
      typical “RealTime/Embedded” engineering. And so, often rejected, or not seen as relevant.

      Although there examples too dissimular in many casses, the concepts can be useful. There is
      no valid reason not to incorporate there modern approach of software-engineering into *our*
      process.
