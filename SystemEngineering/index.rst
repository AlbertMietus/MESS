   There always has been some anarchy about the `architect`’s role --and even more distraction when we combine it with
   `software` and/or `system`. I'm not going to solve that. Not today ...

Likewise, the terms `System Engineer` and `System Architect` are often interchanged. Some companies see *system
architecting* as a broader, heavier role than *system engineering*, whereas others reverse that! Likewise --and to make
the confusion bigger-- some system architects describe their role as *system engineering*.

This also as 'architecting' doesn't sound like a verb.  Especially in the Netherlands: the architect is an acknowledged
(but ambiguous) role, whereas the verb *“architecturen”* does not exist!

Besides, the time of the *ivory tower architect* is gone. But that doesn’t entail the activities are gone!

IMHO, we should minimize the upfront design/architecting work without disregarding the activity.

In this agile era, it’s even more important to explain: why and how “architecting” --at all levels-– should be
executed. One of the reasons to write the blogs and articles here.
