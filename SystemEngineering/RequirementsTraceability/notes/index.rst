***********************
Particulars of ‘needs’
***********************

The main objective of this blog is introducing “Requirements Traceability” in general; especially in an agile
environment or when a roadmap of product-releases exists. That is done demoing :need_count:`type=='demo'` products,
:need_count:`type=='req'` requirements, :need_count:`type=='spec'` specification, and :need_count:`type=='test'`
tests. Also, some generated graphs and tables are shown.

Those ‘needs’ aren’t just text; they are ‘life’ defined and generated by a plugin called *needs* in the *sphinx-doc*
documenting tool; which is just to generate this website. Partly, because I like this toolset. But also to show you that
is can be done.

And despite this blog is not about (learning) a tool, this section will go a step deeper: It will show you how it is
done; without becoming a tutorial on ‘sphinx’ or ‘needs’.

Possible, you like it and would love to play with the demo. Or, you are inquisitive whether this is truly
*not text-only*.

The following pages show some excerpts of the *“RST-code”*, that is used to defined all ‘needs’.  Feel free to
study the ‘sources’ and learn from it.

I will even document the tricks needed for “:ref:`about_forgotten_test`”.
