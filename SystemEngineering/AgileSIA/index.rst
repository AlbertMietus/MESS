   The **SIA** -- an acronym for *System* (or Software) *Impact Analyse* -- is an often used approach to get insight into
   the costs, risks, and possibilities of implementing a feature. It should result in a readable document to
   decide whether it adds value to implement that feature and offer options on how
   |BR|
   But is also a document that is repeatedly incorrectly used.

   The classical SIA isn't very Lean nor Agile; certainly not when it became an (upfront) design document, as
   often ...

   On second thought, a good SIA is lean and agile. A short, up-front *“think ahead”* document makes it possible
   to postpone details to future sprints and assist the Product-Owner in picking the right solution without adding
   costs.

   Let’s study how we can write an Agile SIA. One with business value.

   * In this workshop, we design ‘a bumper’. Or actually: we write the SIA for it.
   * By using a not-software example, it is easier to *not focus* on the technicalities that shouldn't be in the SIA
     anyhow
   * For mechanical engineers: I’m probably oversimplifying and missing relevant details. Sorry for that.

     I welcome feedback to improve!
