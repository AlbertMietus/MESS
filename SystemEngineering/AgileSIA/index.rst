   The **SIA** -- an acronym for *System* (or Software) *Impact Analysis* -- is an often used approach to get insight into
   the costs, risks, and possibilities of implementing a feature. It should result in a readable document to
   decide whether it adds value to implement that feature and offer options on how
   |BR|
   But is also a document that is repeatedly incorrectly used.

   The classical SIA isn't very Lean nor Agile; certainly not when it became an (upfront) design document, as
   often ...

   On second thought, a good SIA is lean and agile. A short, up-front *“think ahead”* document makes it possible
   to postpone details to future sprints and assist the Product Owner in picking the right solution without adding
   costs.

   Let’s study how we can write an Agile SIA. One with business value.

   * In this workshop, we design ‘a bumper’. Or actually: we write the SIA for it.
   * By using a not-software example, it is easier to *not focus* on the technicalities that shouldn't be in the SIA
     anyhow
   * For mechanical engineers: I’m probably oversimplifying and missing relevant details. Sorry about that:-)

     I welcome feedback to improve!
