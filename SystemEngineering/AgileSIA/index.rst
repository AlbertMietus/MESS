   The **SIA** -- an acronym for *System* (or Software) *Impact Analyse* -- is an often used approach to get insight into
   the costs, risks, and possibilities of implementing a feature. It should result in a readable document to
   decide whether it adds value to implement that feature and how.

   But is also a document that is repeatedly used incorrectly.

   Sometimes it becomes more like a design document, with too many detailed technicalities. As a consequence, the
   SIA phase is expensive, and deciding not to go forward becomes impractical. At the same time, it’s often “too much
   work” to suggest more as one solution; another limitation of the goal: select the one with the most value.

   Especially in this lean/agile era, this *expensive* up-front design is (considered) wrong. We prefer to make
   design choices late *in the sprint*.

   On second thought, a good SIA is lean and agile. Having a light, up-front “think ahead” document makes it possible
   to postpone details to later sprints and assist the Product-Owner (*PO*) in picking the right solution without adding
   costs.

   Let’s study how we can write such an Agile SIA, one with business value.
