=========================
2) The Authentic Solution
=========================

.. seealso:: This *second* chapter of the SIA contains the first of the typical three solutions. It will resolve **all**
   needs as demanded in :ref:`The Problem analyse <SIA-demo-H1>`.

   But in another way than in “:ref:`SIA-demo-H3`” or “:ref:`SIA-demo-H4`”. *'Other'*, as in providing other business
   needs.

Outline
=======

The basic idea of this proposal is to shop for a second-hand (set of) bumper(s). We assume we can find the bumpers of
an “Oldsmobile” kind of car quickly. They are doubtless bent or rusty, but we can fix that.

A huge advantage is they adhere to the classic ‘70-image of the typical muscle car. Would it be great to reuse the bumpers
of a `1966 Pontiac GTO <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontiac_GTO>`__?

Pros & Cons
===========

* The cost of those bumpers is low, depending on their quality. A bit of restoration work will be needed, but nothing we
  can't handle.
* This solution fits the current “one of a kind” demands. It will not scale to mass production.
* This *reuse* approach might also nicely fit in your new “green, environmentally” concept.
* As we need to search for (existing) bumpers, it is hard to predict exactly when we will find one (actually: 2).
* There is even a (slight) risk we can’t find one. To constrain that, one of the other two options should be selected
  as a backup.

.. tip:: Even this very short introduction already shows we are communicating in “car language”, not into the details of
         the solution.
