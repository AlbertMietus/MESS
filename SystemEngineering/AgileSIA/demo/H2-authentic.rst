.. _SIA-demo-H2:

=========================
2) The Authentic solution
=========================

.. seealso:: This *second* chapter of the SIA contains the first, of typical three, solution. It will resolve **all** needs as
   demanded in :ref:`The Problem analyse <SIA-demo-H1>`.
   |BR|
   But in another way as in :ref:`SIA-demo-H3` or :ref:`SIA-demo-H4`. Other, as in providing other business-needs.

Outline
=======

The basic idea of this proposal is to shop for a second hand (set of) bumper(s). We assume we can find the bumpers of
“olds mobile” kind of car quickly. They are doubtless a bit bent or rusty, but we can fix that.

The big advantage is they adhere to classic 1970-imago of the typical muscle car. Would it be great to reuse the bumpers
of a `1966 Pontiac GTO <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontiac_GTO>`__?

Pros & Cons
===========

* The cost of those bumpers are low, depending on there arise, but need a bit of work.
* This solution fits the current “one of a kind” demands. It will not scale to mass production
* This *reuse* approach might also nicely fit in your new “green, environmentally” concept.
* As we need to search for (existing) bumpers, it hard to predict exactly when we will find one (actually: 2)
* There is even a (slight) risk, we can’t find one. To constrain that, one of the other two options should be selected
  as backup.

.. tip:: Even this very short into to H2, already shows we are communicating is “car language”, not into the details of
         the solution.
