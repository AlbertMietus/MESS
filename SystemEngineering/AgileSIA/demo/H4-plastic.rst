.. _SIA-demo-H4:

====================
4) Plastic Fantastic
====================

.. seealso:: This third solution, in chapter-4, is again a completely differed approach to achieve :ref:`needs <SIA-demo-H1>`.
   |BR|
   Whether you like it, or prefer :ref:`SIA-demo-H2` or :ref:`SIA-demo-H3`, is not really relevant! That topic is not
   part of the (all) solutions,  see the next (and last) chapter “:ref:`SIA-demo-H5`” for that!

Outline
=======

As might know, we have a department that can “3D print” big plastics, including standard bumpers -- we deliver hundreds
of them, for the aftermarket. Using this facility we can create safe, secure bumpers in any shape and size, in hours!
|BR|
Although almost any color(combination) of plastics is possible (making it robust, as the color is “inside), it is not
very shiny. But we can add a “chrome finish”.

This solution has several benefits. It is cost-effective and quick (far beter the any other solution). But most
important, it makes it easy to meet formal regulation (e.g. crash test) as they are pre-validated. Combined with the
great flexibility in mount-points, it makes assembling and validation of the car easy.


Pros & Cons
===========

* It is fast, fast, fast. We can deliver a first version next week. It’s also cost effective: An extra “try out” version
  (not shiny) cost virtually nothing.
* Also, assembling and validation is easy (see above)
* It does meet all requirements, but it is a plastic solution, not a metal one. It’s generally considered as more secure
  as metal, but your bumper-magnets will not stick.
* We can use this options as backup of :ref:`SIA_demo-H2`
* We can also provide this option as first, fast option, and switch to another oe whenever this one isn't “shiny enough”

  (in this case, we have need to switch in sprint- 2 or -3; otherwise we have to replan

.. note:: Again, this is just an outlook for the chapter. But we keep it (extra) short for training goals 

.. tip:: Can you see the author is enthusiastic on this option?

   .. caution::  Being enthusiastic is fine, but avoid the pitfall of “advertising”!
