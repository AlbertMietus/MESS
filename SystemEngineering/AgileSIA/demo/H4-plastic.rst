.. _SIA-demo-H4:

====================
4) Plastic Fantastic
====================

.. seealso:: This third solution, in chapter-4, is again a completely different approach to achieving the same
   :ref:`needs <SIA-demo-H1>`.
   |BR|
   Whether you like it, or prefer :ref:`SIA-demo-H2` or :ref:`SIA-demo-H3`, is not relevant! That topic is not
   part of the (all) solutions,  see the next (and last) chapter “:ref:`SIA-demo-H5`” for that!

   -- :ref:`AgileSIA-5chapters`


Outline
=======

As might know, we have a department that can “3D print” big plastics, including standard bumpers -- we deliver hundreds
of them, for the aftermarket. Using this facility we can create safe, secure bumpers in any shape and size, in hours!
|BR|
Although almost any colour (combination) of plastics is possible (making it robust, as the colour is “inside), it is not
very shiny. But we can add a “chrome finish”.

This solution has several benefits. It is cost-effective and quick (far better than any other solution). But most
important, it makes it easy to meet formal regulations (e.g. crash tests) as they are pre-validated. Combined with the
great flexibility in mounting points, it makes assembling and validating the car easy.


Pros & Cons
===========

* It is fast, fast, fast. We can deliver the first version next week. It’s also cost-effective: An extra “try-out” version
  (not shiny) cost virtually nothing.
* Also, assembling and validation become easy (see above).
* It does meet all requirements --but it is a plastic solution, not a metal one. Plastic bumpers are generally
  considered more secure  than metal, but your bumper magnets will not stick!
* We can use this option as the backup of :ref:`SIA-demo-H2`.
* We can also provide this option as a first, fast option and switch to another one whenever this one isn't “shiny
  enough”. 
  |BR|
  (in this case, we need to switch in sprint- 2 or -3; otherwise, we have to replan).

.. note:: Again, this is just an outlook for the chapter. But we keep it (extra) short for training goals.

.. tip:: Can you see that the author is enthusiastic about this option?

   .. caution::  Being enthusiastic is fine, but avoid the pitfall of “advertising”!
