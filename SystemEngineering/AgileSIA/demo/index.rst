.. _SIA-demo:

*******************
Demo: Make a bumper
*******************

This demo is (far) outside the software sphere to help you to focus on the Agile SIA. And aren't derived from the SIA by
typical software-engineering fixations.  I assume you are familiar with this common car background but not addicted to it.

We use the :ref:`AgileSIA-5chapters`. However, every chapter is extra short. Your SIA should be short, but some body
text to make it readable is appreciated.

Before you write your 1st genuine Agile SIA, I advise you to practice on a software-engineering topic. My training has
one, but it isnâ€™t published (yet).


.. hint:: Background

   In this demo, our client is building an impressive **Green Muscle Car**. We just advised him to put his best men
   (and women) on the electric engine, the battery and the breaks. We also convinced him to trust us for *non-core
   components*, like the luxury, leader steering wheel, and the bumpers.

   He agreed and asked us to write an Agile SIA for the bumper.
