================
5) How To Choose
================

.. seealso:: This *last* chapter is a short overview and/or tips on “**How** to choose”.

   .. Caution:: Don’t advise on which solution is best!

      Plz, do not get trapped in the pitfall to advise which solution *is* the best-- all should be ‘great’.
      But *‘great’*, for other (business) reasons. Some are cheaper, some are faster, etc.

      You merely advise on how the PO (client/...) shall select one of the solutions. “When T2M is most important, ...”,
      or “When you target the top market, ...”, etc.

   -- :ref:`AgileSIA-5chapters`

We have presented three completely different solutions, each with its pros & cons. All do fulfil all needs as
given in the 1ste chapter [:ref:`SIA-demo-H1`].
|BR|
Now, it is time to decide which one you prefer to continue with -- as a polite reminder: [:need:`BUMPER_April1`]. So, hope
for a quick decision.

Therefore, we present some tips.

Tips
====

Which requirements are most prominent
-------------------------------------

Even though all requirements are met in every solution, some needs might have a bit more weight. So, let’s go over the
most relevant ones.

.. rubric:: :need:`BUMPER_chrome` & :need:`BUMPER_SafetyImago`

When we like to impress on looks, the “Oldsmobile fenders” [:ref:`SIA-demo-H2`] beets all other solutions. Whereas
[:ref:`SIA-demo-H4`] is the most safe solution.

The brand-new chrome solution [:ref:`SIA-demo-H3`] is a nice combination for both requirements: safe and shiny.

.. rubric:: :need:`BUMPER_April1`

Solution “:ref:`SIA-demo-H2`” involves finding a second-hand “Oldsmobile bumper”. This should be easy but has a risk on
timing. So, whenever we like to minimize risk, this solution isn’t preferable.
|BR|
Whereas the high-volume [:ref:`SIA-demo-H4`] option is very, very fast and has no risk of meeting the deadline at all;
therefore we even mentioned it as a backup scenario.

.. rubric::  :need:`BUMPER_Green`

As the bumper is important but not the most expensive part, you can also consider to play on safe. For example, use the
cost-effective fast [:ref:`SIA-demo-H4`] solution as a backup, and select one of the other two as the main solution.
|BR|
This guarantees a good bumper on time. And enables a risk-free great option.

.. tip:: Skip :need:`BUMPER_1is2`

   It’s obvious, two bumpers are needed. All solutions are in harmony here. So the is no need to handle it here.

Other factors
-------------

.. rubric:: scalable & future

Although it, is not a need, this ‘first eco-friendly muscle car’ is a first. And we assume (many) more will
follow. Therefore we spend a few words on that too.

[:ref:`SIA-demo-H3`] & [:ref:`SIA-demo-H4`] are the most scalable. There is no upper limit on the number of bumpers we
can deliver.
|BR|
Price-wise, the plastic solution is cheaper. However, the piece price of a (new, labour-intensive) chrome bumper will
go down when volume rises.
