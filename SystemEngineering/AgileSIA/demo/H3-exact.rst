.. _SIA-demo-H3:

=====================
3) The Exact Solution
=====================

.. seealso:: This *third* chapter of the SIA contains a second. Again **all** :ref:`needs <SIA-demo-H1>` are
   fulfilled. But with other considerations on the importance of them. Where ":ref:`SIA-demo-H2`" is creative, this one
   is more classical.  The next one “:ref:`SIA-demo-H4`” will be completely different again.

   -- :ref:`AgileSIA-5chapters`


Outline
=======

We can develop a completely new “chrome bumper”, with the required old style. This gives the looks and robust image you
are looking for. As is completely  new, we can make it fit exactly on the measurements you need. Not only for the size/width
of the car but also for all bolts-and-nuts you need.
|BR|
This might even help to assemble the car quickly and easily

Pros & Cons
===========

* It will always fit but takes a lot of labour. And so, cost.
* Working with chrome is complex; it needs time to “Stabilise” (compare it with paint that has to dry).  That rest
  period cost nothing but affects the (overall) planning.
* Roughly, we need 13 steps, with on average a week in between
  |BR|
  Note: this is not applicable for :math:`{\alpha}`- and :math:`{\beta}`-versions; they are faster.
* This option is scalable; whenever more cars aka bumpers are needed


.. attention:: This demo is small and we skip a lot of (relevant) details.

   For example, we *mention* the “assembly” topic and address the location of the bolts, nuts, and holes,  but only very
   slightly. 
   |BR|
   An SIA (even an agile one) frequently has sub-chapters on those (functional) slices. They can be introduced in
   chapter-1 or at one of the solutions. This mostly depends on how generic the “slice’ is in the solutions.

   .. tip:: Some slices that for this bumper example could be relevant:

      * Mounting/Assembling
      * Reliability
      * Validation of the complete car; and how the bumper solution can help.
      * ...

   To say something cleaver, including the effect on cost, duration, risks, etc a (prematurely) design may be
   needed -- I clearly didn't (nor can't) do it as I’m not a mechanic.
   |BR|
   But remember: a SIA is not a design document! Design (whiteboard style) just enough to underpin your
   statements. Don’t present it to your stakeholders
