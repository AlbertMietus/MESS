.. _SIA-demo-H3:

=====================
3) The exact solution
=====================

.. seealso:: This *third* chapter of the SIA contains a second. Again **all** :ref:`needs <SIA-demo-H1>` are
   fulfilled. But with another considerations on the importance of them. Where :ref:`SIA-demo-H2` is creative, this one
   is more classical.  The next one (:ref:`SIA-demo-H4`) will be completely differ again.

   -- :ref:`AgileSIA-5chapters`


Outline
=======

We can develop a complete new “chrome bumper”, with the required old style. This gives the looks, and robust image your
are looking for. As is completely  new, we can make it fit exactly on the measurements you need. No only for the size/width
of the car, but also all for all bolts-and-nuts you need.
|BR|
This might even help to assemble the car quickly and easily

Pros & Cons
===========

* It will always fit, but takes a lot of labor. And so cost.
* Working with chrome is complex; it needs time to “Stabilise” (compare it with paint that has to dry). Even that rest
  period cost nothing, it has effect on the planning.
* Roughly, we need 13 steps, with on average a week in between
  |BR|
  Note: this is not applicable for :math:`{\alpha}`- and :math:`{\beta}`-versions; they are faster.
* This options is scalable; whenever more cars aka bumpers are needed


.. attention:: This demo is small and we skip a lot of (relevant) details.

   By example, we *mention* the “assembly” topic and adress the location of the bolts-and-nuts, but only very slightly.
   |BR|
   A SIA (even an agile one) frequently has sub-chapters on those (functional) slices. They can be introduces in
   chapter-1, or in one of the solution. Depending in the (non functional) needs

   .. tip:: Some slices that for this bumper-example could be relevant:

      * Mounting/Assembling
      * Reliability
      * Validation (of the complete car; and how the bumper-solution can help
      * ...

   To say something cleaver, including the effect on cost, duration, risks, etc a (prematurely) design may be
   needed. (I clearly didn't (not can't) do it,  as I’m not a mechanic).
   |BR|
   But remember: a SIA is not a design document! Design (whiteboard style) just enough to underpin your
   statements. Don’t present it to your stakeholders
